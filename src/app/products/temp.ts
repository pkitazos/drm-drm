  //   even more vintage-styled instrument from Rickenbacker, a company to whom tradition is
  //   everything.</p>`,
  // productDetail: `Pete Townshend asked us to reprise and update his beloved Model 1993
  //   guitar and we were only too happy to oblige. The result is the 1993Plus, enhanced with a
  //   1/8 inch (3.1 mm) wider neck, Caribbean rosewood fingerboard and more stable two-piece neck
  //   design fitted with a round heel for comfort. This classic 12-string design comes standard
  //   with three vintage reissue pickups, stereo output, trapeze tailpiece, vintage knobs and
  //   F-hole. Double body binding and pearlescent inlays add a refined touch. X-bracing in the
  //   body helps to bring out the full, rich and warm sounds our instruments are known for. The
  //   haunting, melodic chorus characteristics of our 12-strings continue to benefit from
  //   evolution.`,
