This is the code repository for our submission for this year's GuitarGuitar challenge at DYHTG.

## About the project

It's an E-commerce web app built with the T3 stack designed to cater to both admins and customers.

On the admin side, you can view details about the products you sell, the orders you have and the customers you've served. You can create new or edit existing products, and view analytics about your sales and customers.


On the customer side, you can browse a catalog of products, sign in to your account, add products to your shopping cart, view and interact with your past history of orders, benefit from the company loyalty scheme and purchase items.

We implemented role based access restricting certain actions and pages to certain user roles.
